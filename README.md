# Google Homepage - The Odin Project

This is the first introductory project for the web development course by The Odin Project.

**Until now I learned:**

	 - *flexbox layout*
	 - *grid layout*
	 - *responsive design*
	 - *relative/absolute/fixed/sticky/static positions*
	 - *applied visual design*
	- *class (top to bottom) < id < inline style < !important*
 - Basics of HTML (repetition is the mother of wisdom)
	 -	*applied accessibility*
